# lispy-compiler
To learn about how compilers are built, I built my own. Though I know it's clich√©d, for the sake of simplicity I chose the same ol' lisp-like language every build-your-own-compiler beginner chooses, hence the name of the project.

## Language
The only thing you can do is call functions. This is the syntax:
```js
(funcName
  'arg1. This is how you write a string'
  1234
  (nestedFuncCall 'foo' 21 'bar')
)
```
Whitespace is only important as a token delimiter. All whitespace is treated equally ("whitespace" refers to anything that matches `/\s/`).

## Use
This is useless. Don't use it. I only built it to learn about compiler design.

However, if despite all this you still insist on playing around with it, here's what you need to do:

### Setup
```bash
mkdir pathToProj

cd pathToProj

git clone https://github.com/kylejlin/lispy-compiler.git

npm install
```

### Available Scripts
```bash
npm run start # Run with hot-reloading (thanks nodemon!)

npm run build # Build with Babel

npm run test # Test with Jest

npm run main # Run built version (same as node dist/index.js)
```
